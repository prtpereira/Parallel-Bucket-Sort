# Efficient Bucket Sort Algorithm

- Implementation of a sequential Bucket Sort algorithm

- Development of a multithreading implementation of the Bucket Sort

- Parallelization of Bucket Sort using multiprocessing techniques

- Optimization Bucket Sort using an hybrid approach of multithreading and multiprocessing

** Used OpenMP for multithreading and MPI for multiprocessing
